# Lesson 11 - Skyscraper

This lesson continues with more exciting building projects. We are going to write a program to build a tall skyscraper.

Present the code in `skyscraper.py`. Explain how it works. In particular notice the steps that are created to climb each floor (this code should be familiar from the earlier exercise). Notice that a loop is also used to create successive floors.

Have the young coders consider how long it would take for them to take to create the skyscraper by hand, and how disappointed they would be if it was destroyed. Neither of these are a concern when we have a program that creates it.

# Exercises

## Beginner

Change the materials used for the floor and walls of the skyscraper.

Change the size and number of floors used in the skyscraper. Remember, though, that the Minecraft World on the Raspberry Pi only goes 64 blocks above sea level - it is very easy for us to exceed that in our program.

## Intermediate

Have a doorway made at the foot of the tower. For now this could just be a hole (hint: "AIR" is actually a Minecraft block type). After the next lesson you should be able to use an actual door.

## Advanced

Get creative with the skyscraper. Are you able to place items on specific floors only, or make a more elaborate construction out of, say, bricks and glass for the walls?
