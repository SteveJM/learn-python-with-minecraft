# Lesson 13 - Adventure

By now we have explored many aspects of the Minecraft API. We can write programs that can create any object that we can create by hand, this can be done in a repeatable manner. Remember that we can check on the player's location, and even move them to a different place. Did you know we can also tell when the play hits a block?

We could also have the player 'Collect' items by having our program remember where they are and then removing them if the player goes to that location.

We could also have a door that refuses to let the player walk through until that have collected a certain object.

Have the young coders brainstorm other ideas that they could do within the Minecraft world.

Now lets run `adventure.py`. Notice that the player is given a challenge to find a secret room. Have the young coders explore the world to see if they can complete the quest.

Hint: Once they have collected enough flowers they will be allowed to enter the house. Inside, if they hit the diamond block a secret passage will appear in the corner of the room. If they go down the passage, then they will find the secret room.

# Exercises

## Beginner

Can you change the quantity and type of objects that have to be collected?

## Intermediate

Can you tell the player how many flowers they have collected each time they collect one?

## Advanced

Extend the Adventure by building in further stages of the puzzle to solve. Here are some ideas:

* A "poisoned" flower that if collected results in something bad happening, for example the player being sent to a well.

* A second house that must be visited first to obtain a item before the player can open the door to the house with the dungeon below it.

* A "special" block that must be hit before the player is able to access the next part of the game.
