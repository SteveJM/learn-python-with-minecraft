# Lesson 3 - Teleporting

In this lesson we are going to move the "Player" around in the Minecraft World.

Remind the young coders of the three dimensional nature of the Minecraft world. Remind them how X and Y represent moving across from side to side and up or down and Z represents moving forwards and backwards. By now they should be starting to understand the three-dimensional nature of the Minecraft world.

Present the code in `teleport.py` to the young coders. It is a good idea to have them type it in as you go.

As the code is presented to the young coders explain what each line does. Most of the code should already be familiar as it is the same as the previous examples.

The first few lines should be very familiar by now.

Explain that "x" and "z" are variables that are set to the desired teleport location. The program must then find out how high the terrain is at that location, as there might be a mountain, or gully there. This is stored in a further variable, "y". Finally, we can use the three variables to set the player's location within the Minecraft World.

Run the program. Check that it runs without any errors. If an error is displayed, do not panic, it just means that you need to fix the program and run it again.

Ask the young coders to manually move the player to another location and run the program again. They should then see the position of the player change back to the previous location. Ask the young coders to repeat this exercise several times so that they get used to the position going back to the same location each time.

In the next lesson we will do a little bit more with Minecraft.

# Exercises

## Beginner

Choose a different location and run your program again. Be careful to choose values that are within the area allowed by the Minecraft world.

## Intermediate

Can you set the player to a corner of the world.

## Advanced

Can you make the player "fly" above the chosen location? (Hint: Add a small offset to the 'Y' value).
