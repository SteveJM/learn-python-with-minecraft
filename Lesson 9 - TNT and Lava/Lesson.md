# Lesson 9 - Lava Flow

We are now going to create lava flows in the Minecraft world. This lesson is best executed in the Minecraft World in which blocks of TNT were exploded, as those explosions would have created some useful craters.

Present the code in `laveFlow.py` to the young coders. It is a good idea to have them type it in as you go.

Explain to the young coders how the program works and explain how it creates the lava flow near to the player so that they can find it easily. Explain how it first allows some lave to flow for a while, then it pours water on it for a short period before stopping the water.

Have the young coders run the program and check for errors. They should also watch the Minecraft world. The should see the lava flowing for a while and then water being poured on it. The might need to move to a better location that has a great cliff-edge for the lava to flow down.

In the next lesson we will do a little bit more with Minecraft.

# Exercises

## Beginner

Experiment with different time periods for the lava and water elements to flow.

## Intermediate

Create a crater near to where the lava will flow. Hint: For best effect the TNT may need to be placed at a different offset to the Lava.
