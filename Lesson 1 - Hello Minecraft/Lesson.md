# Lesson 1 - Hello Minecraft

In this lesson we are going to start on our jouney to learn Python by creating programs that use Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi.

Present the code in `hello_minecraft.py` to the young coders. It is a good idea to have them type it in as you go.

Note that Python is very critical in how the code is entered, in particular the use of upper case and lower case letters. Often variables and function names are spelt using what we call camel case, where the words (except for the very first word) start with an upper case letter, like "postToChat". Notice how the upper case letters appear like humps on a camel's back.

As the code is presented to the young coders explain what each line does.

Line 1: This is a good way to start all of our Python programs, it will allow us to run our programs more easily in future.

Line 2: Python is a very flexible language. The people who designed Python made it so that it could be used for lots of different things, but they would not have been able to know about everything that it would be used for. They probably did not know about Minecraft, or perhaps it did not even exist when they designed Python. So this lines tells Python, that Minecraft exists and can be used. All of our programs that use Minecraft will need this line.

Empty lines can be placed anywhere in our program to split it up a bit and make it easier to read.

Line 4: Is where we `connect` to Minecraft. Before we run our program we must have Minecraft running with a `world` created and visible on the Raspberry Pi. Notice that we store the connection in a variable, called `mc`. We will be using this variable each time we want to interact with Minecraft.

Line 6: Displays a message in the Minecraft World.

Run the program. Check that it runs without any errors. If an error is displayed, do not panic, it just means that you need to fix the program and run it again.

Do you see the message appear in the Minecraft window?

Ok, now make it print something else instead.

Well done, you have created your first Python program that interacts with Minecraft.

In the next lesson we will do a little bit more with Minecraft.

# Exercises

## Beginner

Change the message

## Intermediate

Make the program display a series of messages.

Are you able to make each message appear after a short delay (hint: Google "Python time sleep")

## Advanced

Run the Python program from the command line.
