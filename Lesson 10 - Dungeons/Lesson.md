# Lesson 10 - Dungeons

Now things are going to get a lot more exciting. The young coders are going to create their very own Dungeon network.

For this exercise you will provide all of the code in this folder to the young coders. The files should all be in a single directory.

The exercise only requires the coders to edit the `myDungeon.py` program, notice that this program imports the other Dungeon modules, the coders must leave line 2 as it is.

Start by having the young coders run the `myDungeon.py` program as it is and then explore the Minecraft world. Notice that a dungeon entrance is created poking up above a large area of water. Have them enter the dungeon and explore, at the bottom of the steps they will find a room, off to the Left hand side (west), they should find a further room. Notice that the created Dungeon can not be edited by the player.

Explain how the Dungeon program allows a more elaborate program to be created by making further calls to `dungeon.createRoom()`. Notice that each call requires two arguments; an existing room and a direction. There are comments explaining the allowed values. Notice that it is safe to keep re-running the `myDungeon.py` program it completely replaces the previous one.

It is a good idea to have the young coders plan out their dungeon designs on a piece of paper.

You should also bear in mind that the Minecraft Would is relatively limited, using a program like this we are able to rapidly fill out the usable area.

# Exercises

## Beginner

Extend the dungeon by creating more rooms.

## Advanced

Explore the `Dungeon.py` file. Take a copy as a backup. Now try to alter the dungeon design. Can you change the material that is used for the floor or walls.
