# Lesson 2 - Where In The World

In this lesson we are going to find out the location of the "Player" within the Minecraft "World".

Explain to the young coders the three dimensional world of Minecraft. Explain How X and Y represent coordinates moving across from side to side and up or down and then how Z is represents moving forwards or backwards. Relate this to the three-dimensional nature of their surroundings. Note that X and Z change according to the direction that they are facing.

Present the code in `where_am_i.py` to the young coders. It is a good idea to have them type it in as you go.

As the code is presented to the young coders explain what each line does. Most of the code should already be familiar as it is similar to the previous example.

The main difference is lines 6 nad 7. Line 6 gets the players position within the Minecraft World, line 7 prints it out. Notice that because we use `print` it comes out in the terminal, not in the Minecraft Window.

Run the program. Check that it runs without any errors. If an error is displayed, do not panic, it just means that you need to fix the program and run it again.

In the next lesson we will do a little bit more with Minecraft.

# Exercises

## Beginner

Move around in the Minecraft world and run the program again, notice how the values change.

## Intermediate
Can you fly and see how the values change.

## Advanced

How can you move so that only the 'X' or the 'Z' value change?
